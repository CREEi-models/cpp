The YMPE is the yearly maximum pensionable earnings for CPP. It is indexed every year to reflect growth in wages and prices (inflation). The function setearn allows to obtain the years in which the individual theoretically could have started to contribute (either at age 18 or 1966) and the maximum age at which he could contribute (either his current age or if larger the late retirement age of 70). In future applications, one can fill years to zero when the individual has not worked in a given year. "
